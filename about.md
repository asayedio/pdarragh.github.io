Hullo!

I'm a research associate at the [University of Utah](https://www.utah.edu) in the U Combinator research group, which
focuses on programming language theory.

I am also a graduate of the same university, having [simultaneously graduated with my BS and MS in computer science](https://www.cs.utah.edu/bsms/)
in the spring of 2018. I had undergraduate emphases in programming languages and natural language processing (among
other things), and I minored in linguistics.

My primary interest in programming languages is language design and how that impacts a programmer's perspective, and
I especially like to learn about type systems and how they can empower programmers. I also have experience working with
parsing, and have spent much of my free time over the past couple of years working on my own programming language,
[Viper](https://github.com/pdarragh/Viper), which is designed to be a Python-like language with additional features
from other languages I like. (Development on Viper comes and goes in waves, but it's always on my mind.)

Within natural language processing, I am honestly interested in most areas. I think the idea of computers being able to
"understand" human language is incredibly intriguing, and something I am very excited about. In linguistics, my main
interest is in phonology; the idea that humans can generate so many distinct speech sounds is absolutely fascinating!

I work in a research lab on-campus which is focused on programming languages and static analysis. We are currently
working on a project designed to identify potential algorithmic complexity and side-channel attacks in compiled Java
applications, funded by DARPA (an agency under the Department of Defence). We have also recently begun work on a new
Java decompiler, though this work is still in the early stages. In addition, we pursue other avenues of research
whenever they present themselves to us.

Outside of computer science, I enjoy reading books, watching movies, playing Magic: The Gathering, photography,
playing guitar, eating, and otherwise enjoying the company of my friends.
