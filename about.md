I'm a computer science student at the [University of Utah](https://www.utah.edu), expecting to graduate with
[both my BS and MS](https://www.cs.utah.edu/bsms/) in the spring of this year (2018).

I am primarily focused on natural language processing (NLP), with a side-interest in programming language theory (PLT).
Within NLP, I am most interested in the intersection of computer science with formal phonological theory. I would like
to get into speech recognition most of all, but I also am interested in most other aspects of NLP that I've come across.
In PLT, I like learning about type theories, the design of programming language syntax, and plenty of other aspects that
I come across in my readings. 

During the academic year I work in a research lab on-campus which is focused on programming languages and static
analysis. We are currently working on a project designed to identify potential side-channel attacks in compiled Java
applications. In addition, we pursue other avenues of research when they present themselves to us.

Outside of computer science, I enjoy photography, playing guitar, reading books, watching movies, eating, and otherwise
enjoying the company of my friends.
