I'm a computer science student at the [University of Utah](https://www.utah.edu), expecting to graduate with
[both my BS and MS](https://www.cs.utah.edu/bsms/) in the spring of next year (2018). My interests in CS lie primarily
with programming languages and natural language processing (the latter of which fits well with my minor in linguistics).

During the academic year I work in a research lab on-campus, but this summer I'll be heading to Cupertino to intern with
Apple! I'm very excited about it, so I'll be using this site to catalog my thoughts during my time there.

Outside of computer science, I enjoy photography, playing guitar, reading books, eating, and otherwise enjoying the
company of my friends. I'll probably have posts about these topics and more at some point!
