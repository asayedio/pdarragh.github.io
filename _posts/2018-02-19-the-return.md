I've decided to return to this blog, with a refocused effort on regular updates. The purpose is primarily to give me a
platform where I can write my ideas and thoughts about various things, sort of like a journal. It will also serve as a
way for me to practice my writing, since I think I could use some work on that front. I expect I'll make a few more
posts today or over the next few days to write down anything I think should be recorded, but the rest of this post will
give a quick highlight of what's been going on lately.

- I've changed focus from programming languages to natural language processing. (This will definitely be getting its own
post).
- I've made a goal to read more books this year.
- I have been using the [Bullet Journal](http://bulletjournal.com/) system since the beginning of the year *and I love
it*.
- I've been watching a lot of movies with friends. We got [Movie Pass subscriptions](https://www.moviepass.com/) and so
far have really been getting our money's worth out of it.
- I've made progress in my own programming language project, Viper.
- I've also embarked on a new personal project which... will definitely need its own post to help me develop my
thoughts.
- I've applied for PhD programs.
- I'm planning to graduate in May of this year.
- And then I'm planning to go to Hong Kong and Thailand with some friends. (Yay photography opportunities!)
- And *then* I'm planning to go to London and Paris with my parents. (Even *more* photography opportunities!)

I think those are most of the interesting tidbits from my life lately. Some will be expanded upon, and the others will
still probably be mentioned here and there, but either way you're sure to hear more about them!
