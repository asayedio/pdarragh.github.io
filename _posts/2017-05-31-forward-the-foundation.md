I've finished the second prequel to Asimov's Foundation series. (You can read my review of the first book, *Prelude to
Foundation*, [here](/blog/2017/05/15/prelude-to-foundation).) This book takes place shortly after the events of the
previous book, and predates the contents of the first of Asimov's Foundation books, *Foundation*. Below I'll go into a
bit of detail on my thoughts on the book, but the TL;DR is: *wow*. Loved it. Seriously. Better than the last one.

I mentioned in the previous post that I've read (most of) this series before, but it's been a while — maybe five or six
years. This is long enough that I can remember the overall story, but not many of the details. I love reading books at
this point, because it's recent enough that I remember my love for it and the excitement throughout reading, but it's
also long enough that I've forgotten practically all of the crucial details until the author is divulging them to me
anew once more. Some people don't like rereading books, but I am certainly not one of them!

As much as I praised the previous novel for Asimov's excellent writing style... *this one is markedly better*. I don't
know exactly how or why, but something about the way he writes really speaks to me and motivates me to continue reading.
It's just so... *inviting*. I dunno. It's kind of hard to explain, haha.

I think one of the most impressive things about this book is the pacing. In *Prelude*, we follow Hari Seldon's race
across Trantor during a time in his life which later comes to be known as "The Flight". There are multiple climaxes
throughout the story, but the entire chronicle takes place within about a year.

*Forward* is very different in that there are multiple major segments of the book, and each segment is separated by
quite a few years. The book starts off eight years after the end of *Prelude*, and then each successive portion is
at least a decade after the previous. Each of these portions has its own complete plot — an entire story within the
story — and I think that's incredibly impressive. At no point does it get tiresome or irritating to read a book written
this way.

But as I mentioned in the previous post about *Prelude*, it's really amazing to me that Asimov had the ability to see
the entirety of this story from the beginning (or at least enough of it). And I know that these two prequel novels were
actually written after the core *Foundation* trilogy, but it's still incredible to me how Asimov was able to plan out
everything so well and space out the different segments in such a way as to make it truly believable.

And I think that's what separates his science fiction works from many others. While many of the technologies don't exist
(we certainly don't have faster-than-light "jump" capabilities!), within the framework of Asimov's world it is clear
that everything in these books is *reasonable*. Practically all science fiction requires some capability on the part of
the reader for suspension of disbelief, of course. But Asimov never asks any more of the reader; you are never told
something which is inconsistent with previous knowledge, or which somehow requires a new "magical" explanation to
justify its inclusion in the story. It's all very natural, to a degree, and I think that's one of the things I really
like about it.

There's not really much more for me to say here, other than: a solid five stars!
