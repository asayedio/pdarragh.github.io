Well, I finally did it! I've started a personal blog. I don't expect many people to read it, but I intend to use it
mostly to keep track of my thoughts as well as to improve my writing. I guess we'll see how it goes!

Of course the site is built on Jekyll, hosted by GitHub Pages (yay free things!). I'm not much into web development, so
I'm sticking to simple templates for everything. (Why reinvent the wheel, right?)

As for what to look forward to (oh you know you're looking forward to things), I intend to chronicle thoughts on
articles I read, projects I'm working on, photography, book reviews, and really anything else that comes up.

Well... without further ado, I should get to work writing something!
